# GitHub Action for Go Fuzz

This action runs [Go Fuzzing](https://go.dev/security/fuzz/) on GitHub Actions.

## Usage

Create a workflow file such as `.github/workflows/fuzz.yml` in your repository:

```yaml
name: "fuzz"
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  schedule:
    - cron: "36 2 * * 1,4"

permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  list:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 10
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-go@v4
        with:
          go-version: "stable"
      - id: list
        uses: shogo82148/actions-go-fuzz/list@v0
    outputs:
      fuzz-tests: ${{steps.list.outputs.fuzz-tests}}

  fuzz:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 360
    needs: list
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        include: ${{fromJson(needs.list.outputs.fuzz-tests)}}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-go@v4
        with:
          go-version: "stable"
      - uses: shogo82148/actions-go-fuzz/run@v0
        with:
          packages: ${{ matrix.package }}
          fuzz-regexp: ${{ matrix.func }}
          fuzz-time: "355m"
```

The `actions-go-fuzz` runs fuzz tests by `go test -fuzz FuzzFoo`, commits [failing input](https://go.dev/security/fuzz/#glos-failing-input) and create a pull request if fuzz tests fails.
See [an example of a pull request](https://github.com/shogo82148/actions-go-fuzz/pull/53) generated by the action.

## Permissions

The `actions-go-fuzz` action requires the following GitHub permissions:

- `contents: write`
- `pull-requests: write`

You can specify the permissions in the workflow YAML file:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write

```
